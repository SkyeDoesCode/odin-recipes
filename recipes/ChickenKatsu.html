    <p>Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken</strong>
            : You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasonings</strong>
            : This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Flour</strong>
            : All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Egg</strong>
            : An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Panko</strong> 
            : Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Oil</strong>
            : Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>Butterfly the chicken by slicing them horizontally but not all the way through, then open them like a book</li>
        <li>Pound the chicken breast to an even thickness to ensure even cooking</li>
