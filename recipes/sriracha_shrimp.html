    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>500g shrimp</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp salt</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp avocado oil (or any healthy alternative)</li>
        <li>4 tsp Sriracha sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and peel shrimp, defrosting if needed. Lately we've been buying frozen, deveined, easy-peel shrimp. All I have to do is defrost, peel, and cook! You can also buy your shrimp already peeled if you'd like!</li>
        <li>Pat shrimp dry and season with paprika, cayenne, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well to coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan or skillet to medium-high heat with 1 TBSP of oil and sauté your shrimp. Cook on each side for about 2 minutes until shrimp curl and become opaque. The cook time will depend on the heat setting you choose and the size of your shrimp, but regardless they’ll be perfectly cooked in a matter of minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Sriracha (start with a little and add more to taste based on spice preference) and toss shrimp to coat. Enjoy hot!</li>
    </ol>
